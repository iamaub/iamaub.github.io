Hello World :) I'm Bruneck. I am 24 year-old Cybersecurity Engineer. Passionate about technology and driven by an insatiable curiosity, I believe that there are no limits to what i can learn. 

Over the years, I've cultivated a keen interest in ethical hacking( I’m not hacker tho , I’m a security professional).

In an offensive posture, I can perform intrusion tests(Pentesting AD , Network, Systems, Web) to identify security vulnerabilities and recommend remediation strategies.

In a defensive posture, i can perform Triage, Incident response, Vulnerability management, Threat hunting, Cyber threat intelligence analysis. This way i can reduce organizational risk by: Rapidly remediating active attacks, Advising on improvements to threat protection practices and referring violations of organizational policies to appropriate stakeholders.

I am a self-described purple teamer, as I am actively sharpening my offensive and defensive skills on platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Portswigger, Proving Ground etc.

I'm inspired by challenges and motivated by a genuine passion for making the digital world more secure. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects.
